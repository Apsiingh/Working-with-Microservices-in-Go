# Working with Microservices in Go

This project is a hands-on journey into building, testing, and deploying microservices using Go (Golang). It covers a wide range of essential concepts and tools needed to work with microservices architecture, from creating basic services to deploying them using Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

## üöß What We'll Build

A front-end web application that connects to multiple microservices:

### Microservices Overview

- **Broker** ‚Äì Acts as an optional single point of entry to all other microservices.
- **Authentication** ‚Äì Manages user authentication and token issuance, backed by **PostgreSQL**.
- **Logger** ‚Äì Centralized logging service using **MongoDB**.
- **Mail** ‚Äì Sends emails using a predefined template.
- **Listener** ‚Äì Listens to messages from **RabbitMQ** and triggers appropriate backend logic.

### Communication Between Microservices

We‚Äôll explore multiple strategies for inter-service communication:

- **REST API** with JSON as transport
- **RPC** (Remote Procedure Call)
- **gRPC** using Protocol Buffers for high performance
- **AMQP** (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) for event-driven messaging with RabbitMQ
